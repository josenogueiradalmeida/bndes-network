# LACChain - BNDES Network #

This repository is created as part of the relationship between LACChain Alliance and Banco de desarrollo de Brazil - BNDES to deploy a Public-Permissioned Blockchain Network maintained by both parts in order to develop and execute a different type of projects.

## Introduction

* LACChain Test Networks are DLT infrastructure developed, maintained and provided by the [LACChain Alliance](https://www.iadb.org/en/news/global-alliance-promote-use-blockchain-latin-america-and-caribbean). These networks are classified as public-permissioned blockchain infrastructure, according to the standard [ISO/TC 307](https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html). 

* As public blockchain networks, LACChain Networks are open to any entity in Latin America and the Caribbean. As permissioned networks, entities must be authenticated and commit to comply with the law in order to be permissioned. The [permissioning process](https://github.com/lacchain/pantheon-network/blob/master/PERMISSIONING_PROCESS.md) involves filling a very short [registration agreement form](https://github.com/lacchain/besu-network/blob/master/NODE_AGREEMENT.md). By using the network, you implicitly accept that you have read and understood the terms of reference, and you agree with them.

* The nodes of LACChain DLT public-permissioned networks can be classified into two groups, according to their relevance for the functioning of the network. The two groups are core and satellite nodes. In each of these two groups there are also two different types of nodes, according to the specific taks they can perform. Core nodes are grouped in validator and boot nodes, and satellite nodes are classified into writer and observer nodes. For more information you can go to [Topology and Architecture](https://github.com/lacchain/pantheon-network/blob/master/TOPOLOGY_AND_ARCHITECTURE.md).

* This LACChain Test Network uses [Hyperledger Besu](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/besu), an open-source, mainnet compatible, Java based, and Apache 2.0 licensed Ethereum client. For more information you can read the [code](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu) and the [documentation](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu-docs).

* This LACChain Besu network uses [IBFT2.0](https://docs.pantheon.pegasys.tech/en/latest/Consensus-Protocols/IBFT/) consensus protocol for the validation of transactions and generation of new blocks.

* We are developing different monitoring tools to show the performance and activity of the network. Currently, we have available the [EthStats](http://dashboard.lacchain.net/) and the [Transaction Explorer](http://explorer.lacchain.net/). We will be providing more dashboards and monitoring tools soon.

* We have created two guides to help you [Deploy your Dapp on LACChain](https://github.com/lacchain/besu-network/blob/master/DEPLOY_APPLICATIONS.md) and [provide your Dapp with a suitable archiecture](https://github.com/lacchain/besu-network/blob/master/DAPP_ARCHITECTURE.md).

* We are developing different free tools on LACChain that you can use or replicate. At present, you can enjoy our [LACChain Notarizer](https://notarizer.lacchain.net/) that allows you to prove that a document or a file has not been modified over time. It uses our open source [credentail server](https://github.com/lacchain/credential-server) and [hashing service](https://github.com/lacchain/hashing-service). If you have any questions, you can [check the FAQ](https://medium.com/@lacchain.official/lacchain-notarizer-faq-6ae3dbb3441e).

* We have also develop some services that allow to check that your nodes are working properly. The [Besu Health Check](https://github.com/lacchain/besu-healthcheck) helps users test interactions with a Besu node by accessing it through RPC. [Node Health Check](https://github.com/lacchain/node-health-check) can be used to guarante availability of the orion transaction manager. These two services are automatically deployed when using the Ansible installation provided below in this document.

## Deploy a Full Node
